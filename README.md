# Sorting Algorithms in C++

This project is a simple **C++ console application** that demonstrates the implementation of multiple **sorting algorithms**. It allows users to input an array, choose a sorting technique, and view the sorted output.

The project is intended for **learning purposes**, especially for students studying **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.

---

## Project Goals

* Understand and implement fundamental sorting algorithms
* Compare different sorting techniques through a menu-driven program
* Practice clean C++ coding and modular function design
* Serve as a beginner-friendly reference for DSA concepts

---

## Sorting Algorithms Implemented

* **Bubble Sort**
* **Merge Sort** (recursive, returns merged arrays)
* **Insertion Sort**
* **Selection Sort**
* **Quick Sort**

## ▶How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aditya-0510/devsecops-lab2.git
cd devsecops-lab2
```

2. Compile the program:

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o sort
```

3. Run the executable:

```bash
./sort
```

## Sample Workflow

1. Enter number of elements
2. Enter array values
3. Choose a sorting algorithm from the menu
4. View the sorted output

Created as part of a learning exercise in **C++ and DSA**.
